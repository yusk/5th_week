/* *IMPORTANT*
 *
 * There is some manual coordination required between the NV storage code and
 * the application code that uses it.
 *
 * On the application side, NV storage is organized into "data sets". Each
 * data set is described by a table of pointers and lengths of data in the
 * set. The length of the table is variable; the last entry is recognized
 * by having a NULL pointer and a zero length.
 *
 * The NV storage functions define a struct, NvStructuredPage_t, that contains
 * some overhead information plus a client data area. The size of the client
 * data area is based on the page size provided by the NV storage HAL.
 *
 * A single application data set must not be larger than the client area of
 * an NvStructuredPage_t.
 *
 * The data sets used by the application code are defined at compile time
 * in NV_Data.c, in NvDataSetTable[]. The size of that array must be defined
 * in this file, to make it available to the NV storage code.
 *
 * The NV storage HAL must have at least one more page available
 * to it than the number of data sets defined by the application. Generally,
 * this requires coordinating the NV HAL and linker commands to reserve
 * flash memory pages. The details are handled in the NV storage code.
 *
 * Some compiler preprocessors have enough access to the compiler's symbol
 * table to be able to take the sizeof() a C struct. Some don't, making
 * #if tests of the number of data sets vs. the number of page, and of
 * the sizes of the data set, impossible. This module defines both values
 * as magic constants. The actual values are determined by hardware
 * requirements and the linker command file, which is not available to
 * C code.
 *
 * Since these contsants cannot be reliably checked at compile time, the NV
 * module checks them at run time. If the debugging compile flag is turned
 * on in the NV code, the NV module initialization function will assert
 * (infinite loop) if:
 *      1) There is not at least one more NV storage page available then
 *      there are data sets, or
 *      2) If any data set is larger than the client data area of an NV
 *      storage page.

/* Data sets are only saved by the idle task. There is no save-immediately
 * capability.
 *
 * There are three save mechansims, each with it's own API function.
 *      1) NvSaveOnIdle(): save the next time the idle task runs. This
 *      will save the data set at least as soon as either of the other
 *      functions, and usually sooner.
 *
 *      2) NvSaveOnInterval(): save no more often than a given time
 *      interval. If it has been at least that long since the last save,
 *      this function will cause a save the next time the idle task runs.
 *
 *      3) NvSaveOnCount(): increment a counter that is associated with the
 *      data set. When that counter equals or exceeds some trigger value,
 *      save the next time the idle task runs.
 *
 * The data set will be saved to NV storage during the next execution of
 * the idle task if:
 *      NvSaveOnIdle() has been called,
 *  OR
 *      NvSaveOnInterval() has been called, and at least the specified
 *      time has past since the last save,
 *  OR
 *      NvSaveOnCount() has been called at least as often as the counter's
 *      trigger value since the last save.
 *
 * All three functions cause NvIsDataSetDirty() to return TRUE. No API is
 * provided to allow the client to know which save function or functions
 * have been called. The data set is either believed to be identical to
 * the saved copy (== not ditry) or not identical (== dirty).
 *
 * The NV code does not require a data set to have a mininum-time-between-
 * saves or a minimum-count-between-saves. A data set may have both.
 *
 * Whenever a data set is saved for any reason:
 *      it's dirty flag is cleared
 *  AND
 *      it's minimum-time-between-saves timer is restarted from 0,
 *  AND
 *      it's minimum-count-between-saves counter is set to 0.
